Hi Everybody Welcome Back To Genius Infomedia. Today I want to show you guys the best arch based distros of 2020.

2020 Has been a horrible year for almost everything other than linux.

There are a lot of Linux YouTube channels that have literally doubled their subscriber counts this year and many who joined this year like us.

So lets get into it!!!

## 1)Mainline Arch

Arch has always been this elitist ,cool guys only distro. But it really is not. It is not very tough to install if you have a good guide. I have my own guide on my [GitHub](https://github.com/aryas221/geniusawesome/blob/main/arch%20guide) which looks kind of bad. So I’m planning on making a tutorial on this website.

### Pros:

* It gives you the choice to install whatever you want. (other than init system :((( lol )
* It is very minimal
* It has 200% compatibility with the Arch wiki!!!
* BTW I use Arch / Bragging rights (Very very very important)

### Cons:

* Command line installer can be difficult for some people
* Doesn’t use gnu/hurd (joke)
* A bit of a learn and do community who don’t spoonfeed you the answers to your errors.

Country Of Orgin : Canada

Company Behind It : No Company, Community distro

# 2) Manjaro

Manjaro is a great distro for beginners. It has a gui installer (calamares to be precise) which is superb. They have alot of flavours ranging from official xfce and kde to community awesome and cinnamon. The problem with the community editions is that it is not very coherent. I remember when i used the cinnamon flavour of manjaro in my test machine a long time back and it had office 365 online but if you see in the official flavours they use libre office / free office. There are more examples of this. Even other community editions are different from each other.

Country Of Orgin : Germany

Company Behind It : Manjaro GMBH

### Pros:

* Great Installer
* Pamac and octopi are exceptionally good frontends to pacman and the aur and either one or both in some cases come preinstalled with every manjaro install community or official
* Excellent community.
* Great Nvidia support
* Arm support even though i couldnt get wifi working on my pi 400. (probably because I installed the pi 4 version.)

### Cons:

* Allows you to install proprietary software (ie. FreeOffice) in the official installer.
* Editions are not coherent at all
* Other editions have alot of proprietary software in them.
* Window managers have very beginnery configs and no suckless software.

# 3) Arco Linuxb:

Arco Linux previously known as archmergeb is my daily driver. It has alot of options Including awesome bspwm cinnamon deepin dwm gnome plasma xmonad openbox i3 xfce and much more. This distro has alot of great tools like grub-customizer for customizing grub, a tweak tool for installing new de and wm, changing neofetch, changing termite, changing themes for awesome and i3 ,adblocker etc. The person behind arco linux, Erik Dubois uploads alot of videos in his [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/erikdubois) about arco and arch and some occasional void linux. Even though the arco commuity is small, you can get away with your doubts because of his content.

Country Of Orgin : Belgium

Company Behind it : No company, only one main dev and some devs who contribute a bit.

### Pros:

* Lots Of Options For Window Managers And Desktop Environments with great configs.
* You Can Install most of your apps through the calamares installer (including proprietary ones like discord and TeamViewer)
* Yay Is preinstalled (saying this coz yay takes a million yeaars to compile)
* We can choose over kernel from latest, lts , and zen with and without nvidia drivers.

### Cons :

* Proprietary Software can be installed during install
* Small community

# 4)Artix

Love it or hate it systemd is bloated and almost all non fsf arch based distros use systemd. luckily for us we have one star, artix. artix has both gui and command line installer. They have runit openrc and s6 as init systems.Artix has alot of differences from arch compared to other distros due to the fact that alot has to be done to take out all the systemd stuff from arch.

Country Of Orgin : Global

Company behind it : Community made

### Pros:

* Because there is no systemd, the system is way more faster than arch itself
* It has both gui and command line installers giving everybody a chance to use this distro.
* there are a variety of desktop environments for the graphical installer
* Best distro to fight against systemd as this is one of the only distros that simply dont give a systemd offering compared to counterparts like parabola who give systemd offerings.

### Cons:

* Many applications and de like gnome don’t work because they have systemd as a dependency.
* As this is a very niche distro, most aur apps simply aren’t optimized for other init systems

# 5) Garuda Linux

Garuda Linux is a very different arch based distro. Its marketing says that it is built for gaming but in my opinion it is a beauty distro rebranded. But on one side it had a very slow install time in my core i3 6th gen laptop with a 100mbps wifi connected. But after the install it was a great distro. It uses the zen kernel which gives it a bit of an advantage.

Country Of Orgin : India

Company behind it : a bunch of people

### Pros:

* Uses the zen kernel and has alot of performance tweaks.
* Has really beautiful desktop.
* Their website is just plain awesome
* Have alot of desktop environments and window managers (ie.KDE, GNOME, Xfce, Cinnamon, MATE, LXQt-kwin, Deepin, Wayfire, BSPWM and i3wm.)

### Cons:

* The install takes forever
* Their ultimate isos are big and their installer installs heck alot of stuff.
